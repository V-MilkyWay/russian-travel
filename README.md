# Проект 3: Путешествие по России

# **Russian-travel**   
   
## **Description:**   
   
 This is my second independent project - **Single-page website**. I'm practicing my skills! So far, the project is in the works, but you can already see the use of some technologies from the largest Russian IT company - **Yandex!**   
   
## **Used technologies:**   
   
 1. **BEM** (*Block, Element, Modifier*) - is a component approach to web development based on the principle of dividing the interface into independent blocks. BEM is used in Yandex for frontend development.   
   
 2. **Media Queries** - you can create styles  for small mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and large monitors.
